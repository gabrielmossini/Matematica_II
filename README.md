# Math_II 🤔💭🔢✖️🧮
## Program for Vector Implementation I.

<body>
    <p>This program was developed during my second year of studying Computer Science as part of the Math II course. It is written in Python 🐍 and utilizes numpy as np along with the math module. The main project file is named main.py.</p>
    <p>The program offers the following functionalities, all tailored for 3x3 vectors:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Vector Module</li>
        <li>Vector Addition</li>
        <li>Vector Subtraction</li>
        <li>Rule of Sarrus</li>
        <li>Scalar Multiplication</li>
        <li>Vector Multiplication</li>
    </ol>
